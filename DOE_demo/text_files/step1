Welcome to Teachers!

During this quick journey, we're going to learn how to make websites using the computer language HTML. HTML is a great language to start with in understandoing basic syntax and rules when building web content. First things first, what's HTML?

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
A markup language uses tags (such as < >) to identify content instead of other programming languages that uses scripts to execute a function.

An example of a tag is <p>.

Action: Please put <p> at the beginning of each of your answers.
Ex. 
<p>I teach at Bronx High School of Visual Arts.
<p>My students are 12th graders.
<p>My passion is using data and tech to uplift people, build solutions and create opportunities.



In the world of HTML, our main elements (such as "p") have both opening tags and closing tags to enclose content.

When we successfully wrap our content, the information within the tags will be visible on the browser. Here's how to complete a closing tag </>.

For the element p, our closing tag would look like this -> </p>.

If I need to have an opening tag and closing tag to wrap my content. Where will I put my closing tag in the example below?
