Please continue to put a closing tag at the end of each of your sentences.

With the content (with this example, a sentence) completely wrapped by an opening tag and a closing tag, your content will be visible.


At the moment though, you're unable to see anything in the browser. To have an HTML website, we will need the appropriate HTML structure. Let's make a sandwich.


Step 2

With every sandwich (standard-wise) there are two pieces of bread to hold everything together: a beginning piece of bread and an ending piece of bread; an opening tag and a closing tag.

Since we're writing in HTML, we have to let our browser know that we're working in an HTML document. We do this by having the following:

<html>
</html>

These two tags are your opening and closing pieces of bread; without it, your website will not be whole and cease to exist. The html tags holds all the content (text, pictures, videos, etc.) within your webpage.

Please surround your content with the html tags.
Your text editor will look something like this:
<html>
<p>I teach at Bronx High School of Visual Arts.</p>
<p>My students are 12th graders.</p>
<p>My passion is using data and tech to uplift people, build solutions and create opportunities.</p>
</html>
