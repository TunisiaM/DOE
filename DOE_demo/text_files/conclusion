Conclusion:

Now let's view your browser. You should see something like this:

It looks the same, but we can rest easily knowing that the program is in good format.

Let's add a couple of bonuses:
1. Create a title tag: <title></title> within your head, so your tab area has a label.
2. Let's add a header for the answers you've provided at the beginning of class. We do this by adding a heading tag; there's six to choose from: h1-h6. The higher the number the smaller the text size.

Your code should look like this:
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Tunisia</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h2>Tunisia Mitchell's Story</h2>
		<p>I teach at Bronx High School of Visual Arts.</p>
		<p>My students are 12th graders.</p>
		<p>My passion is using data and tech to uplift people, build solutions and create opportunities.</p>
	</body>
</html>

3. Let's add your favorite color so everything can pop! Kindly change your body tag, by adding an attribute: bg color="". Your code should look like this
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Tunisia</title>
	</head>
	<body bgcolor="">
		<h2>Tunisia Mitchell's Story</h2>
		<p>I teach at Bronx High School of Visual Arts.</p>
		<p>My students are 12th graders.</p>
		<p>My passion is using data and tech to uplift people, build solutions and create opportunities.</p>
	</body>
</html>

Please select a color of your choosing from the HTML Color Picker on this website: http://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp
