Let's recap.

We've learned that HTML stands for Hypertext ___ Language.

When beginning a website, we have to program within a certain environment. What environment must we write in? 

In order to create content for the web in HTML, we must enclose all of our content within ____. Hint --> <>

To create an HTML structure, we must have <html> and </__>

So we have our basic website, but there are a few key elements missing for this to be accurate. Let's go back to our sandwich.

For a sandwich, we always have two pieces of bread... but what about the stuff inside? What if I wanted a burger, with lettuce and tomatoes?

In an HTML document, we have two main elements that are always there:
<head></head>
<body></body>

Your head element contains all the non-visual information not seen within your webpage and/or browser. This is extremely important when it comes to the computer language CSS and learning how to style your html pages.

Your body tag contains all the visual content within your webpage.

Step 4

Please place the head tag and body tag within your text editor. It should look something like this:

<html>
	<head>
	</head>
	<body>
		<p>I teach at Bronx High School of Visual Arts.</p>
		<p>My students are 12th graders.</p>
		<p>My passion is using data and tech to uplift people, build solutions and create opportunities.</p>
	</body>
</html>

I've indented my head, body, and p elements so I can show my associations:
The p tag belongs to the body.
The body and head tags belong to html.

Why else do you think I've indented?
